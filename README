Turntable.fm Bot

Objectives:
 - Prevent idle time from going over x seconds
 - Automatically grab a DJ spot when one becomes available
 - Respond to idle checks

Build:
  coffee --bare -l --watch --compile *.coffee

Run:
	$.getScript('main.js')

Possible Additions:
 - fix upload button
 - cancel afk response
 - Identify songs that have been played recently, and alert if you have them
 	(or even just move them down the queue)
 - call fixUI on room change, and reset handlers
 - If the track is bombing, say something in chat and skip
 - Lookup unknown artists on Freebase or last.fm to determine proximity to a 
 	good/bad artist and vote accordingly
 - could I use python nltk to get a better idea of the sentence structure?
